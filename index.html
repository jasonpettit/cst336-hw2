      <hr>
      <p>Let's create an Mad-lib! Ad libitum is latin for "at one's pleasure" or "as you desire".  Mad-libs follow
      that style by asking you to select words "as you desire" to complete an unknown story.  Mad-libs were invented 
      1953, and were first released in 1958, by Leonard Stern and Roger Price.

      </p>
      <p>The inputs for Mad-libs are words that will be placed into the unknown story, where a word of that type is needed.</p>
